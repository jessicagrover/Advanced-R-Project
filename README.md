The "Stat650" project focuses on analyzing stock price data using R programming language. It begins with data loading and exploration, examining unique symbols and the structure of the dataset. The project includes data preprocessing steps such as converting date columns to the appropriate date format using the lubridate package. Visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of data over time, including monthly and daily trends in stock prices. Time series analysis techniques are applied to summarize and visualize trends in stock prices over the observed period. The project provides valuable insights into stock price movements for specific symbols, aiding investors and analysts in making informed decisions. The code and visualizations offered are reproducible, providing a framework for similar analyses on other financial datasets.
